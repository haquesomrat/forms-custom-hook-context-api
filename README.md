# form master(types of form)

- use form tag and onSubmit handler on event(e)
- from e, access e.target.(name of the input).value to get values

- controlled element: use individual field state for each input field
- controlled element: one object in a state holding all the input fields value
- uncontrolled element: use useRef to create a reference to the element and access value like :nameRef.current.value

- use hook to handle states, submit and error. example: react hook form
- Resuable form

## context api implementation

- create a context and import it
- add provider for the context with a value and value could be anything
- useContext to access value in the context API

# Topics I practice in this project

- different types of forms
- controlled and uncotrolled components
- useRef
- custom hooks
